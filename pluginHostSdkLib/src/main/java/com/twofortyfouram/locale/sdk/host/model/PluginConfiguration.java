     * <p>While preserving user choice is always important, some plug-ins are so malicious, buggy,
     * otherwise problematic that they must be disabled in order to protect the interests of users.
     * Before anyone panics, it should be noted that plug-ins are only blacklisted under
     * exceptional
     * circumstances.  This API is maintained so that the entire ecosystem can
     * quickly be protected if absolutely necessary.
     * The decision whether to blacklist a plug-in is fully at the discretion of two forty four
     * a.m. LLC, although the following guidelines cover the blacklisting process.  two forty
     * four a.m. LLC's ability to blacklist does not
     * imply that two forty four a.m. LLC is actively or continuously testing plug-ins, nor does it
     * imply two forty four a.m. LLC has any responsibility to police plug-ins.
     * </p>
     * <ol>
     * <li>A plug-in that is malicious is considered a candidate for blacklisting.
     * <li>A plug-in that
     * is so buggy that it fails to function correctly most or all of the time is considered a
     * candidate
     * for
     * blacklisting.  For example, a plug-in designed to toggle Airplane mode for Android 2.3 will
     * not function on Android 4.2, due to new Android security restrictions.  Such a plug-in could
     * be blacklisted.</li>
     * <li>A plug-in that interferes with the normal functioning of the user's phone is
     * a candidate for blacklisting.  For example, a plug-in setting to reboot the user's device
     * could potentially be configured to cause a reboot loop effectively locking the user out of
     * his device.  If the user added this reboot plug-in to the Defaults in Locale
     * then the device would reboot as soon as it finished booting.  To avoid being blacklisted,
     * such a plug-in would need to implement mechanisms to avoid a
     * reboot loop, which might include a cool-down period after the last time it was fired or
     * suppressing firing it after a boot.</li>
     * <li>A plug-in that interferes with the normal functioning of the host is considered a
     * candidate for blacklisting.  For example, a security plug-in which prevents the host's UI
     * from launching by monitoring the Activity stack might be considered a candidate for
     * blacklisting.</li>
     * <li>A plug-in that is malicious, for example uploading private data without disclosure, is a
     * candidate for blacklisting.</li>
     * <li>A plug-in that contains serious security flaws is a candidate for blacklisting.  One
     * example would be a plug-in that stores unencrypted login
     * credentials in {@link com.twofortyfouram.locale.api.Intent#EXTRA_BUNDLE}.  Plug-ins are
     * required to store such credentials in their own app private storage, rather than in the
     * Bundle.  Another example would be a plug-in that logs credentials to logcat.</li>
     * <li>A plug-in that can cost the user a large amount of money is a candidate for
     * blacklisting.
     * For example, a plug-in that automatically sends SMS messages could rack up charges with each
     * outgoing message.  Such a plug-in should implement throttling to limit the total number of
     * messages sent as a safeguard.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <p>Once a plug-in is identified as a candidate for blacklisting, multiple attempts will
     * be made
     * to contact the plug-in developer via email, Google Play, or whatever other mechanism the
     * developer provides for feedback.  If the developer does not respond within 30 days, the
     * plug-in may be blacklisted at the discretion of two forty four a.m. LLC.  If the
     * developer does respond and appropriately addresses
     * all concerns, then the plug-in will be unblacklisted.</p>
